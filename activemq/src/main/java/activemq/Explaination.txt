here we show case two types of jms send and receive mechanism:-

1) send and receive in the same program 
this is done by the MessageSenderAndReceiver which first sends the message to the JMS queue named
"TestQueue" and then retreives the message from it and displays on the logger
it can be run by simply running the class file MessageSenderAndReceiver.java

2) we configured one JMS LIstener using the spring jms:listener-container 
which listens for the messages put on to the queue "TestQueue" and consumes it
this can be run by simply initializing the spring configurations
and by running the main application(Main.java)

Also attached is the activemq.png snapshot showing the messages sent and consumed on the Queue.
